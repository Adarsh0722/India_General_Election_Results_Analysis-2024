2. **State Demographics** – State-wise and constituency-wise analysis of winners, votes, and margins.
3. **Political Landscape** – Alliance and party performance comparison at the state level.
4. **Constituency Analysis** – Candidate-level results, including vote share, turnout, and margins.
5. **Detailed Grid View** – A drill-through table for exporting and exploring granular election data.
6. **Landing Page** – A user-friendly navigation hub to move between dashboards.
